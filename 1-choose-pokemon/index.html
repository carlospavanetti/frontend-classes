        <p>
          Bulbasaur is a small, quadruped Pokémon that has blue-green skin with
          darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like
          structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide
          mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw
          when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp
          claws. On its back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed
          planted there at birth. The bulb provides it with energy through
          photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained
          within.

        <h3>#004 - Charmander</h3>
        <span class="fire-type">Fire</span>
        <p>
          Charmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon with a primarily orange
          body and blue eyes. Its underside from the chest down and the soles of
          its feet are cream-colored. It has two small fangs visible in its
          upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its lower jaw. A fire burns at the
          tip of this Pokémon's slender tail and has blazed there since
          Charmander's birth. The flame can be used as an indication of
          Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pokémon is
          strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and
          blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander dies if its
          flame goes out. However, if the Pokémon is healthy, the flame will
          continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the
          rain.

        <span class="water-type">Water</span>
        <p>
          Squirtle is a small Pokémon that resembles a light blue turtle. While
          it typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on
          all fours in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It has large, purplish or
          reddish eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and
          feet have three pointed digits. The end of its long tail curls inward.
          Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after
          birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and
          has a thick white ridge between the two halves.

        <h3>#387 - Turtwig</h3>
        <span class="grass-type">Grass</span>
        <p>
          Turtwig is a small, light green, quadruped Pokémon resembling a turtle
          or tortoise. Its eyes, feet, and lower jaw are yellow. Its body is
          covered by a brown shell that is composed of earth. The shell has a
          thick black stripe and a black rim. On a very healthy Turtwig, the
          shell should feel moist. A small seedling grows on a brown patch on
          its head. This seedling will wilt if the Pokémon becomes thirsty. As a
          plant-based Pokémon, Turtwig usually nourishes itself through
          photosynthesis. It also drinks water, which hardens its soil-based
          shell. Due to its status as a starter Pokémon, a wild Turtwig is hard
          to come by and it is generally found under the ownership of Trainers.

        <h3>#390 - Chimchar</h3>
        <span class="fire-type">Fire</span>
        <p>
          Chimchar is a bipedal Pokémon resembling a chimpanzee. Its fur is
          primarily a shade of orange, though its face, outer ears, underbelly,
          hands, and feet are light yellow. Its rear has a small, round, red
          patch that is usually obscured by flames produced by burning gas in
          its stomach. These flames go out when it goes to sleep, and burn
          weakly when it feels ill. Its ears are large in comparison to its head
          size and red inside. It has two pointed teeth in its upper jaw.
          Chimchar has red markings nearly surrounding its eyes, a swirl-like
          symbol on its chest, and five fingers on its hands with three toes on
          its feet. It has a swirly crest of hair on its head. Being very agile,
          it is able to climb the rocky ledges of tall mountains, where it
          lives.

        <span class="water-type">Water</span>
        <p>
          Piplup is a light-blue, penguin-like Pokémon, which is covered in
          thick down to insulate against the cold. It has a dark blue head with
          a primarily white face and a short, yellow beak. The dark blue
          feathers on its head extend down its back and around its neck, which
          causes it to appear to be wearing a cape. There are two white ovals on
          its chest and a small, light-blue marking resembles a crown above its
          beak. It has flipper-like arms and yellow feet with three toes each.

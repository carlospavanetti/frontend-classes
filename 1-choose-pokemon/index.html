    <h3>#001 - Bulbasaur</h3>
    <span>Grass</span> <span>Poison</span>
    <p>
      Bulbasaur is a small, quadruped Pokémon that has blue-green skin with
      darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like
      structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth.
      A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth
      is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On its back
      is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth.
      The bulb provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from
      the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.

    <h3>#004 - Charmander</h3>
    <span>Fire</span>
    <p>
      Charmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon with a primarily orange body
      and blue eyes. Its underside from the chest down and the soles of its feet
      are cream-colored. It has two small fangs visible in its upper jaw and two
      smaller fangs in its lower jaw. A fire burns at the tip of this Pokémon's
      slender tail and has blazed there since Charmander's birth. The flame can
      be used as an indication of Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly
      when the Pokémon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it
      is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander dies
      if its flame goes out. However, if the Pokémon is healthy, the flame will
      continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the
      rain.

    <h3>#007 - Squirtle</h3>
    <span>Water</span>
    <p>
      Squirtle is a small Pokémon that resembles a light blue turtle. While it
      typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all
      fours in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It has large, purplish or reddish eyes
      and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet have three
      pointed digits. The end of its long tail curls inward. Its body is encased
      by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown
      on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between
      the two halves.
